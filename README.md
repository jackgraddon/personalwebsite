# My Personal Website

New Theme Button on PC Index page:
- Change the theme (dark or light, light by default)
- Applies to all pages
- Can only change settings on PC (Mobile locked in light mode due to Javascript bugs)
- Button reloads the page because it locks itself after one use, not sure why, this just started recently.
